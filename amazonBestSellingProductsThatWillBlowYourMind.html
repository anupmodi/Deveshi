			<b>Product: <a href="http://www.deveshi.com/click.html?id=B004IPVMAA" class="lightBlue">madesmart Two-Piece Drawer Organizer, Multi-Purpose Drawer Organizer, 12
			Compartments, Multi-Purpose Home Organization, Granite</a></b><br>
			<div class="center"><a href="http://www.deveshi.com/click.html?id=B004IPVMAA"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ab0S5AN5L._AC_.jpg" class="mrTp15" width="327" height="187"/></a></div>
			<p class="mrTp15">I bought these to fit inside the Kallax bookcase&#39;s drawer insert. Most drawer organizers won&#39;t fit
			since the drawers are on the tiny side. This specific organizer fits, however it&#39;s quite little and
			can only contain a few things. Additionally, particularly for the black drawer organizer, the
			dimensions shown on the Amazon website are accurate. The depth of this organizer is described
			as being more than 2 inches tall, but this refers to the depth of these organizers when they are
			stacked one on top of the other (the way they are packaged), not when they are used separately
			as you would in reality. The white organizer, too, has the depth that is depicted.</p>

			<b>Product: <a href="http://www.deveshi.com/click.html?id=B09GJMPRYW" class="lightBlue">Portable Bluetooth Speaker, powerful sound and deep bass, IPX7 waterproof, 12 hours of playtime, JBL PartyBoost for multiple speaker pairing, speaker for home, outdoor and travel (Grey)</a></b><br>
			<div class="center"><a href="http://www.deveshi.com/click.html?id=B09GJMPRYW"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KBmbqDu6L._AC_SX679_.jpg" class="mrTp15" width="300" height="111"/></a></div>
			<p class="mrTp15">The JBL Flip 6 2-way speaker system, which is designed to offer loud, pristine sound, keeps the
			rhythm going. A discrete tweeter generates crisp, clear high frequencies, while the racetrack-
			shaped woofer provides remarkable low and intermediate performance. Additionally, Flip 6 has
			two passive radiators that have been specially adjusted for deep bass utilizing Harman&#39;s
			sophisticated algorithm. The greatest speaker you can ever purchase. The size of the speaker,
			but I was blown away by the sound and quality. The speaker is loud even though it is just 25%
			of the way to halfway. Must purchase.</p>
