
<p>The Qatar diplomacy crisis was born in the month of June, threatening to collapse the very foundation of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Isolated by its neighbours, the State of Qatar was had to deal with the complex situation of defending the charges of terrorist funding and at the same time protecting its citizens from harassment abroad. Over the span of next few weeks, the consequences spilled to the world community at large, when oil trade became an issue. Soon, the European Union and the United States of America issued statements, the former asking for a removal of the blockade while the latter giving controversial  statements, as the President and the Secretary of State had different thought processes. As religious times for the Islamic world approached, the situation worsened, and called for the United Nations to find a solution. The Arab League, which is like a universal set if the Gulf Cooperation Council is considered a subset, played an important role to maintain peace in the region.</p>

<p>The Arab League, with the agenda to end the Qatar Diplomacy crisis was simulated at IPSC MUN, organised at the Daly College, Indore. I represented the Republic of France in this committee. The challenge I faced here was completely novel. This being my 14th MUN as a delegate, and 17th overall, I had a lot of knowledge on debate and diplomacy in committees like the Arab League. However, coming from the most reputed school in Delhi, I had mostly represented the most powerful nation in the committees I did. For instance, I’d done 5 Security Councils, and represented the United States in 3 of them, and the United Kingdom in the other 2. I had the veto power. On the contrary, being France in the Arab League, I was an observer nation. Forget the veto, I didn’t even have the opportunity to sponsor a draft resolution, the most important part of a conventional MUN committee.</p>

<p>The only way out for me to participate in paperwork was to make sure that majority of the crises are solved by working papers, and not draft resolutions. Since a working paper is just a recommendation and not a binding document, observer nations can author them. So, I had to lobby and convince the committee to present working papers. I made sure my speeches had an adequate impact on the committee, so that my work during the unmoderated caucuses was reduced.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the last day, the committee had to present a draft resolution, to solve the crisis as a whole. Since the executive board would accept only a DR, lobbying for a working paper wasn’t an option. So, I figured out a new way. I spoke to the sponsors of my bloc, and made sure that majority of my points are incorporated in their document. When the document was presented, I sent in amendments, which were accepted as friendly amendments, by both the blocs (because I had influenced the committee in my favour over the past 3 days). Ultimately, the DR of the other bloc was passed, but it had my points as well due to amendments presented by me.</p>

<p>Unlike most of my MUNs, this MUN gave me a different experience, by putting me in a tougher situation. I think I handled it well, because, at the end of the day, I walked out with the Best Delegate Award at a national level MUN, where I had defeated students from the best schools in the country.</p>
US Cabinet at TISMUN,
Tagore International School</p>

<p>The idea and concept of MUN has evolved so much over the past few decades that modern day MUNs comprise not only of conventional UN committees, but also of specialised agencies, in which we undergo a detailed simulation of a real life emergency situation, usually behind closed doors. One of my such experiences was at TISMUN’17, held at Tagore International School, towards the end of August. I represented the Vice President of the United States of America, in the United States War Cabinet. It was a historic committee, set in the early 1960s, discussing the Vietnam War. It also comprised of some delegates representing top officials of South Vietnam, making it a joint emergency session to fight the Republic of China (now PRC) and North Vietnam (now Vietnam).</p>

<p>The purpose of such committees is different, compared to that of a Security Council, or an HRC. In such committees, we have to match the concepts of diplomacy, and make sure we efficiently represent our nation, as if at the UN headquarters in New York. I’ve learnt that we cannot question existing international law, or talk about secret missions led by our nation. Our thoughts and actions in most situations are limited to arriving at a collective solution, which not only benefits our nation, but the international community at large. However, in specialised committees like war cabinets, the approach is completely different. It is less about international treaties, and more about personal and national interests. We cannot stand up in the HRC and talk about increasing the Secret Service presence in Guantanamo Bay, but we can candidly tell the President of the US (equivalent of the Chairperson on the executive board of a conventional committee) to send an additional warship of the seventh fleet in the Chinese waters, to impose a blockade and have a better strategic position in the South China Sea. While conventional committees are all about collective solutions, specialised agencies are about protecting personal interests. If these special agencies are historically set, you have the added challenge of altering history.</p>

<p>My simulation of the USA- South Vietnam Cabinet at TISMUN began on 4th August, 1964. Originally, this day saw the Gulf of Tonkin crisis, which gave the United States reason to enter the Vietnam war. However, for the purpose of this simulation, this crisis was deleted from the pages of history, i.e., the timeline was altered. So, the challenge was simple, to give Lyndon B. Johnson (then president of the US), who was on the executive board, a reason to enter the war. While the United States ambassador to the United Nations at that time would be arguing about the harmful effects of communism, a person sitting in the situation room would be thinking about a false flag operation to initiate a war against communism. So, while in conventional committees, we debate on theory and solutions, in specialised committees we debate in practicality.</p>

<p>Being the Vice President, I had an important role to play. Being the second highest authority, and highest amongst the delegates, I could direct the cabinet members and address flaws in their plans. In collaboration with the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defence and the Secretary of State, I formulated a plan for a false flag operation to portray an attack on a United States aircraft by the North Vietnamese army. The beauty of such plans is that they should include the minutest of the details, including the false identity of the supposedly dead pilot and from what part of the White House and at what time will the President offer his condolences.</p>

<p>After presenting the plan to the President, we put it to implementation. I, being the most political on the cabinet, started working on plan to manage the Congress and make them pass a legislation to declare war on North Vietnam. At the end of the day, we passed three directives, with top secret clearance (only for the members of the President’s cabinet). These were detailed pieces of paperwork, two of them explaining the course of action on a map of the region. I was awarded the High Commendation award for my creativity, spontaneity and effective response to the carefully fabricated crisis situation. </p>
