			<h3>Top 4 Products on Amazon</h3><br>
			<p>You must take into account other factors in addition to a product&#39;s popularity while
			making a choice. To make sure that the goods can be transported simply, you must have
			a clear understanding of the product&#39;s shipping prices, Amazon FBA fees, durability, and
			weight.</p><br>
			<p>The ideal price range for the products that are the best-selling ones is $10 to $50, with a
			cap of $100. Consider the level of competition as well and look for an Amazon niche
			where it is less intense so that your products can stand out.</p><br>
